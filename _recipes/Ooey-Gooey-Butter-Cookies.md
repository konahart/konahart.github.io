Adapted from ['allrecipes'](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/16773/gooey-butter-cookies/) <br />
Inspired by 'Lil' Luna': [Monster Eye Cookies](http://lilluna.com/gooey-monster-eye-cookies/), [Multicolor Monster Eye Cookies](http://lilluna.com/gooey-monster-cookies/)

## Ingredients
<ul>
    <li> 1/4 cup fat or oil <a href="#Oil">(notes)</a></li>
    <li> 8 oz cream cheese <a href="#CreamCheese">(notes)</a></li>
    <li> 1 egg or egg substitute:
        <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp water</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> 1/4 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li> 1 package white or yellow cake mix</li>
    <li> powdered/confectioners' sugar</li>
</ul>

### Notes
<ul>
    <li><a name="Oil">Fat or Oil</a>: Recommended options:
        <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegan butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 cup coconut oil, melted</li>
        </ul>
        Or my favorite:
        <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp vegan butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 tbsp coconut oil, melted</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a name="CreamCheese">Cream Cheese</a>: I tried a couple of vegan
    options for cream cheese. I found that Daiya had too strong a taste, which
    even doubling the amoung of vanilla extract couldn't quite mask. Finally
    I landed on Tofutti, which worked excellently. Whipped tofu may work, as
    well, but I have not tried it. Between dairy cream cheese and Tofutti, I 
    found that using vegan cream cheese made for lighter, fluffier cookies, 
    with no noticeable taste difference. </li>
</ul>

## Adaptations / Variations
<ul>
    <li><strong>Halloween</strong>: Add fun colors and candy eyes!
    <a href="http://lilluna.com/gooey-monster-cookies/">Lil' Luna</a> uses neon food
    coloring. I haven't been able to find neon in stores, but using gel icing
    colors can produce really vibrant results. If you go with just 1 color, I
    recommend green. Purple and orange look great, too!</li>

    <li><strong>Red Velvet</strong>: Instead of white or yellow cake mix, use a
    red velvet cake mix. Voil&agrave;!</li>

    <li><strong>Vegan adaptations</strong>:
        <ul>
        <li>Choose non-dairy based fat/oil and cream cheese.</li>
        <li>With regard to finding a cake mix: most of Duncan Hines' cake mixes
        are vegan, though the boxes aren't marked as such. Other big brands may
        be, as well; many vegan bloggers have investigated, so a little
        googling should answer for any specific brand.</li>
        <li>If you want to do Halloween variation, I highly recommend using
        Wilton products. All of their icing colors are vegan, and it is pretty
        easy to find which of their other products are vegan (and kosher!)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

## Instructions
1. Combine cream cheese and softened fat/oil until fluffy.
2. Add in vanilla and egg/egg substitute (and food coloring, if applicable). 
3. Gradually add in cake mix. 
4. Put dough in freezer to chill. Preheat oven to 180&deg;C/350&deg;F and line
cookie sheet with parchment paper.
5. Put powdered sugar on a plate. 
6. When oven is done preheating, take dough out of freezer. Use a spoon to
measure out dough and roll into balls. Roll balls in powdered sugar.
7. Bake 15 to 17 minutes. I found that dough using dairy cream cheese needed a
little longer to bake. 
8. Transfer to wire rack to cool. If adding eyes, give the cookies a few
minutes to cool first so that they eyes do not melt, but it is easier to add
them before the cookies have cooled completely.
