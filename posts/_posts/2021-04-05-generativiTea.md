title: 'GenerativiTea : Creating a little Teabot, short & stout'
---

In February 2020, I gave a talk at Supporting Women in Information Technology & Computing in Hawaii - University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa (SWITCH - UHM) about [@generativiTea](https://twitter.com/generativiTea), an art bot project from a few years previous. Its creation involved the use of data gathering, deep learning, conventional machine learning, and grammars --- a chain of mini-experiments to that amounted into a delightful little bot. I hope these slides inspire you, and if they do, please [let me know](https://twitter.com/konahart)!
