title: User Interface Design for Creative Writing Software
---

## Inspiration
For whatever reason, I can never stop thinking about creative writing software
(you might be familiar with my 
[promptbot project](http://konahart.com/promptbot/)). 
Maybe it's a form of procrastination--forever fidgetting with the software, 
never actually doing the writing. I have tried a number of different programs, 
from [WriteItNow](http://www.ravensheadservices.com/index.php) back in the day,
to [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php), 
to [Writer's Cafe](http://www.writerscafe.co.uk/), 
to [yWriter](http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter5.html), to just about every 
[alternative to Scrivener](http://alternativeto.net/software/scrivener/). 
While many of them are serviceable, most are little more than pared-down word
processors, glorified corkboards, or flow chart makers, and very rarely more 
than one or two of those. Worst of all--to me--all I've seen have the 
clunkiest, ripped-out-of-the-90s user interfaces. Few take advantage of more
recent forms of knowledge organization, such as tagging, nor new forms of
interaction such as touch. None look like they were natively written for 
post-millenial operating systems and devices; to my knowledge, none of them 
were. 

Which is not, in any way, to imply they are totally useless. Certainly word 
processors, corkboards, and flow charts are useful in creative writing.
However, I have found them wanting. Right now I prefer Scrivener because I 
find it the most richly-featured, but still feel constricted by its limited
ways of interacting with my writing and its antiquated-looking interface.

So, when my Human-Computer Interaction seminar discussed 
[Code Bubbles](http://www.andrewbragdon.com/codebubbles_site.asp), my
thoughts immediately turned to how I could apply those design decisions to 
creative writing software. At first I decided that there was not much that
would translate usefully; however, the idea kept churning in my brain, 

On the surface, writing creatively writing has different needs from writing
software. 
 
Also essential to good design is an easily-accessible mental model of how
elements are organized. I think that is part of why so many pieces of 
creative writing software have the same layout: hierarchical file system on one
side--familiar from basic computing; word processor in the middle--also a 
familiar element of basic computing; meta notes on the side, usually 
that look like Post-it notes or index cards--a simple analogy to how one might 
add additional comments to documents in the real world--add additional pieces 
of paper that are tangentially attached. The most novel element is the
occasional inclusion of small notes that are rearrangable in a grid--these are
always akin to index cards, which, like the meta notes, are a simple analogy 
to the physical world. But within that analogy, there is actually a loss of 
usefulness: index cards in the real world can be arranged in more than just a 
grid. This model also consistently fails to make use of the advantages of using
a computer program instead of actual notecards. 

The model of these programs is minimally commital, with only one or two
components being related to the real world, while the rest are unrelated to one
another. The model gives no clear idea of the functionality of its components. 

Instead, I propose a program with a model based around the night sky. 

Just looking at the night sky, you might see a mess of little lights: 
stars, planets, various celestial bodies. These lights (we'll say stars for 
simplicity) have no immediately apparent organizational structure. How are you
to 

By allowing grouping without changing the location of the stars, multiple 


That is the central metaphor of the software I propose: 
Terminology:
* Stars - notes/nodes/vertices
* Constellations - arrangements/relationships/edges
* 

Working titles include 
* Constellations
* Celestial
* Sky Writer
* Written in the Stars
